  Summary
</h1>
<p align="left">
  My project design is based on the idea of creating a learning app that teaches you about the prehistoric era. I had the idea of it being a situation where you are entering a museum, and there are specific exhibits that are available for you to look at and interact with.

  To start, the user can either play without logging in, but their achievements and collections won't be save, or they can log in which uses a firebase backend to save thier achievements etc.
  The user is then taken to a menu screen where they tap on the different parts of the museum to enter different areas of the app.

  Main exhibit - Dinosaur Categorizer
</h2>

  The main exhibit is to do with dinosaurs and this is what you are being tested on with topic quizzes that help you type/categorize specific dinosaurs.

  For the second exhibit, I implemented the accelerometer as a small interactive game, where you need to clean up a fossil until the picture is revealed. You can achieve this by rotating the screen forwards and backwards until the percentage goes up to 100.

  For the third exhibit, I wanted to use location services to provide specific information about the area that the user lives in from the prehistoric era. I also added in a small exhibit about the evolution of the human species.
