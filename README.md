  My project design is based on the idea of creating a learning app that teaches you about the prehistoric era. I had the idea of it being a situation where you are entering a museum, and there are specific exhibits that are available for you to look at and interact with.
  <br><br>
  The main exhibit is to do with dinosaurs and this is what you are being tested on with topic quizzes that help you type/categorize specific dinosaurs.

  For the second exhibit, I implemented the accelerometer as a small interactive game, where you need to clean up a fossil until the picture is revealed. You can achieve this by rotating the screen forwards and backwards until the percentage goes up to 100.
  <br><br>
  For the third exhibit, I wanted to use location services to provide specific information about the area that the user lives in from the prehistoric era. I also added in a small exhibit about the evolution of the human species.
